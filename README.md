Twitter API is paid to use and only sends out some bookmarks at a time, If I have 500 bookmarks on my account twitter api gives out only a few of them to work with not satisfying our requirements, however I used the inspect element and foundout the network URLs which are used internally by the twitter for a post and used chrome cookies and other essentials which are required by the network URL to fetch the post. Even with this I had to run the script multiples times to get all the bookmark data for FREE on to my extension local storage.
